COMPILER:=gcc

#-Werror 
#	Make all warnings into hard errors. Source code which triggers warnings will be rejected
#-Wall 
#	Turns on all optional warnings which are desirable for normal code. At present this is -Wcomment and -Wtrigraphs. Note that many of the preprocessor's warnings are on by default and have no options to control them.
#-Wmissing-prototypes (C only)
#	Warn if a global function is defined without a previous prototype declaration. This warning is issued even if the definition itself provides a prototype. The aim is to detect global functions that fail to be declared in header files.
#-Wmissing-declarations 
#	Warn if a global function is defined without a previous declaration. Do so even if the definition itself provides a prototype. Use this option to detect global functions that are not declared in header files.
